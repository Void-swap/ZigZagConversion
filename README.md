# ZigZag Conversion
The ZigZag Conversion problem is a string manipulation challenge that involves rearranging characters in a given string according to a specific pattern.

# Problem Statement
Given a string s and a non-negative integer numRows.<br>
The task is to convert the input string into a ZigZag pattern.<br>
where the characters are read back and forth in a zigzag manner along the rows.<br>
The number of rows (numRows) determines the height of the ZigZag pattern.

For example, given the input string "PAYPALISHIRING" and numRows = 3,<br>
The ZigZag conversion would look like:<br>
P   A   H   N
A P L S I I G
Y   I   R
